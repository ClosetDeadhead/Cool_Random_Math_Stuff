# Cool_Random_Math_Stuff

<b>textbook_rand.m</b> : a template for a Matlab script that gives you random textbook problems wherein the chapter is chosen as a random integer between 1 and the number of chapters, and then another random integer is chosen for the chapter problem with the range from 1 to the number of problems for that given chapter. Includes a random (50/50) increment or decrement to even numbered problems to ensure the problem is always odd (in an effort to guarantee a textbook solution).
